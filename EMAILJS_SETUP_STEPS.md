# EmailJS Setup - Step by Step

## Current Issue
Your contact form is falling back to mailto because EmailJS isn't properly configured. Let's fix this!

## Step 1: Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Click "Sign Up" (it's free)
3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Add Email Service
1. In EmailJS dashboard, click "Email Services"
2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider:
   - **Gmail**: Most common choice
   - **Outlook**: If you use Microsoft email
   - **Yahoo**: If you use Yahoo email
4. Follow the setup instructions for your provider
5. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the "Service ID" (looks like `service_xxxxxxx`)

## Step 3: Create Email Template
1. Go to "Email Templates"
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Replace the default template with this:

**Subject:**
```
New message from {{from_name}} - {{subject}}
```

**Content:**
```
You have received a new message from your portfolio contact form.

From: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
This email was sent from your portfolio website contact form.
```

4. Click "Save"
5. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the "Template ID" (looks like `template_xxxxxxx`)

## Step 4: Get Public Key
1. Go to "Account" in the left sidebar
2. Click "General"
3. Find "Public Key" section
4. **IMPORTANT**: Copy your public key (looks like `user_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

## Step 5: Update Your .env File
Replace the content in your `.env` file with your actual credentials:

```bash
# Replace these with your actual EmailJS credentials
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_your_actual_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_your_actual_id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=user_your_actual_key

# Your contact email
VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL=jyotirmoykonwarjk@gmail.com
```

## Step 6: Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## Step 7: Test the Setup
1. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173 (or whatever port it shows)
2. Go to the contact form
3. Look for the "ðŸ”§ Debug Info" section (only visible in development)
4. Check that all items show "âœ“ Set" and "âœ“ Yes"
5. Fill out and submit the form
6. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)

## Troubleshooting

### If Debug Info shows "âœ— Missing":
- Double-check your `.env` file has the correct variable names
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign
- Restart the development server

### If EmailJS Loaded shows "âœ— No":
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure you have internet connection
- Try refreshing the page

### If form still opens mailto:
- Check browser console for error messages
- Click "Log Status to Console" button in debug section
- Make sure all environment variables are set correctly

### If emails aren't received:
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Verify the email template in EmailJS dashboard
- Test sending an email directly from EmailJS dashboard

## Quick Test
Once everything is set up, you can test by:
1. Opening browser console (F12)
2. Filling out the contact form
3. Submitting it
4. Looking for success/error messages in console
5. Checking your email

## Need Help?
If you're still having issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Take a screenshot of the debug info section
3. Verify your EmailJS dashboard shows the service and template are active

The debug info will help identify exactly what's missing!
